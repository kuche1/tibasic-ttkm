# tibasic-ttkm

works for ti84+ (the input functions is still missing some keys that cause a crash when pressed)



for TTKM, you need to upload `FINDSTR`, `INPSTR`, `LE*`, `LS*`, `PAUSE`, `SHOWSTR`

everything else is not needed



the software you can use for uploading (and editing) is `TI Connect CE` (win only `:(`)

make sure the calc is passed trough to the VM


[no this actually doesn't work, cuz you can't execute an archived program] PROTIP

you can put the programs in the `archive` memory and benefit SOOO MUCH
