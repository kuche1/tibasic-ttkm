# tibasic-ttkm

works for ti84+ (the input functions is still missing some keys that cause a crash when pressed)

for TTKM, you need to upload `FINDSTR`, `INPSTR`, `LE*`, `LS*`, `PAUSE`, `SHOWSTR`
everything else is not needed

the software you can use for uploading (and editing) is `TI Connect CE` (win only `:(`)
make sure the calc is passed trough to the VM
